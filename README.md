# IMDb Movie Dataset Analysis

## About This Project
This project was about analyzing an IMDb movie database using SQL. I wrote a bunch of queries to find things like the most popular genres, top-rated movies, and which actors and directors worked on the best films. It helped me practice joins, subqueries, and window functions.

## What I Used
- MySQL
- Joins & Subqueries
- Window Functions & CTEs

## What I Learned
- How to use SQL to get insights from a big dataset
- How to rank genres and movies based on ratings
- That SQL window functions are super useful for trend analysis

## File
- `project.sql`
